Why Golang?

~       - C
~1980   - C++
1995    - Java
        - Python
1996    - Ruby
1998    - .NET (C#)

2015    - Golang

Golang
    1. Simplicity
        25 keywords
        - No access modifiers (No public, private, protected , internal etc)
        - No Classes (Only structs)
        - No Inheritance (Only composition)
        - No Exceptions (Only errors)
        - No reference types (Only value types)
        - No pointer arithmetic 
        - No Implicit type conversion

        Paradox Of Choice (Barry Schwartz)

    2. Extremely light weight
        Compiles to native code
        Performance is equivalent to C++

    3. Built FOR concurrency
        concurrency = the ability to have more than one execution path
        OS Threads are costly
            1 OS thread = 2 MB of memory
        1000s of goroutines can be executed using 1 OS thread
        A concurrent operation in golang = a goroutine
        Language has features to help with concurrency
            go keyword, channel (data type), select, range, channel operation ( <- )

Software Requirements
    1. Go compiler - https://go.dev/dl/
    2. Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/

To run a go program
    go run <filename.go>

To create a build   
    go build <filename.go>
    go build -o <build_filename> <filename.go>

To create a build for other platforms
for ex: windows
    
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build <filename.go>
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -o <build_filename> <filename.go>

    The list of other platform configurations can be found at :
        https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment

    To change the default environment variables
        go env -w GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64


Data types in Golang
    string
    bool

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    uint16
    uint32
    uint64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real [float32] + imaginary [float32])
    complex128 (real [float64] + imaginary [float64])

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32)(unicode code point)


Assignment:01
    Write a program that will print all the prime numbers between 3 to 100

Assignment:02 (Console Calculator)    
    Display the following menu 
        1. Add
        2. Subtract
        3. Multiply
        4. Divide
        5. Exit
    If the user choice is 1 - 4, 
        accept 2 numbers 
        perform the respective operation
        print the result
        display the menu again
    if the user choice is 5
        exit from the application
    If the user enters any other choice 
        display "Invalid choice" 
        display the menu again.
