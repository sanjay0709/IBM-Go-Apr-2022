Golang
    1. Simplicity
        25 keywords
        - No access modifiers (No public, private, protected , internal etc)
        - No Classes (Only structs)
        - No Inheritance (Only composition)
        - No Exceptions (Only errors)
        - No reference types (Only value types)
        - No pointer arithmetic 
        - No Implicit type conversion

        Paradox Of Choice (Barry Schwartz)

    2. Extremely light weight
        Compiles to native code
        Performance is equivalent to C++

    3. Built for concurrency
        concurrency = the ability to have more than one execution path
